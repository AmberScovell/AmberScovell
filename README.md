Hi, Iâ€™m Merlin Star. Currently, I am expanding my portfolio to demonstrate my skills and to expand my understanding of psychology, statistics, the intersection between both, and other fields to become a well rounded person and grow. In the future, I would like to work as a professor, a data scientist, or as an academic pertaining to how information is transmitted.

My education is a bachelor's in Mathematics with honors and a master's in Quantitative Psychology. I have past experience with tutoring and customer service.
