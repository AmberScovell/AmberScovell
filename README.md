Hi, Iâ€™m @AmberScovell. I am a recent graduate from Ball State University and I am looking for a data scientist job with a focus on psychological data. Currently, I am expanding my portfolio to demonstrate my skills and to expand my understanding of psychology, statistics, the intersection between both, and other fields to become a well rounded person and grow.
My education is a bachelor's in Mathematics with honors and a master's in Quantitative Psychology. I have past experience with tutoring and customer service.
